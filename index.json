Now I work closely with Prof. Vahid Tarokh (NAE member), Dr. Kai Li, Prof. Yulun Zhang, and Prof. Deng-Ping Fang. Previously, I received my master degree at Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. Xiu Li and obtained my bachelor degree at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications under the guidance of Prof. Hu Zhu and Prof. Guoxia Xu.\nMy research interests revolve around the intersection of low-level vision, concealed object segmentation, and multi-modal large language model. Specifically, I emphasize the utilization of prior knowledge to augment the robustness and generalization capabilities of computer vision algorithms.\nI’m open to any kinds of collaboration. Please feel free to contact me directly through email.\nWe are looking for research assistants. If interested, please feel free to email me directly and cc Prof. Sina Farsiu. I will review and respond to all applicants!\nEmail: chunminghe19990224@gmail.com or chunming.he@duke.edu\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a first-year doctoral student at Duke University advised by Prof. Sina Farsiu.
